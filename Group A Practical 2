''' Write a Python program to store marks scored in subject “Fundamental of Data
Structure” by N students in the class. Write functions to compute following:
a) The average score of class
b) Highest score and lowest score of class
c) Count of students who were absent for the test
d) Display mark with highest frequency '''
